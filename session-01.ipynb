    "    → it's a bird\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question for the group:** How many rules would you need to handle 10,000 different objects? What about unusual cases — a cat with no tail, a dog with pointy ears?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Model-Based Way: Learning from Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing rules, you show the computer **thousands of examples**:\n",
    "- 10,000 photos labeled \"cat\"\n",
    "- 10,000 photos labeled \"dog\"\n",
    "- 10,000 photos labeled \"bird\"\n",

    "**Question 2:** Why does AI struggle with hands and text in images?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: These models learned from millions of images. How many images of hands vs. faces do you think exist online? And does the letter \"A\" always look exactly the same?\n",

    "- Why a photo is funny?\n",
    "- The emotional meaning of a photo?\n",
    "- What happened right before or after the photo?\n",

    "### Key Insight\n",
    "\n",

    "- **What it's bad at** — known limitations\n",
    "- **Who made it** — the team or company\n",

    "**Why this matters:** If a model was trained mostly on English text, it might not work well for other languages. If it was trained on photos of adults, it might not recognize children accurately. The training data shapes everything.\n",
