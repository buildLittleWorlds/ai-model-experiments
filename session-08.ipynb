    "Next session, we move from single models to **systems**. You have been using one model at a time. But real AI applications chain multiple models together -- the output of one becomes the input of the next. This is powerful, but it introduces a new problem: when one model makes a mistake, every model after it gets worse. We will build multi-model pipelines and learn to think about error cascades.\n",
